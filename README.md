# deep-to-web

This is a complex deep learning model I have deployed in Web which is requries over 1.5GB storage. So make sure your storage is larger than 1.5GB. 

Step 1:   

-> Do you want to deploy the site in a server or in your local host? 
  1) Server 
  2) Localhost 

if(Server){

  -> You can use any server, if you would like to use a free server then go for 
  
    Python Anywhere || Heroku 
    
}else{

  -> Download the project 
  
  -> Make sure you have downloaded all the dependencies. 
  
}

Step 2: 

-> Choose a Framework 
  1) Django 
  2) Flask 
  
** This repo is based on Flask, you can also deploy it using Django

Step 3: 

Run the project in terminal & enjoy.
